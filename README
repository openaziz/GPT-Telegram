Installing
----------
Please read the INSTALL file.

Copying
-------
nmh uses a BSD-style license, which should be in the top-level of the
distribution in a file named COPYRIGHT.

Developers
----------
Information of interest to nmh developers can be found in the
README.developers file in the docs subdirectory of this distribution.
If you're hacking on the code, you should also definitely subscribe to
the nmh-workers mailing list. To do so, please visit the nmh-workers
info page at <http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nmh-workers>.
If you're interested in working on nmh, but aren't sure what to do, see
the TODO file in the docs subdirectory. There's plenty of work there.

Working with your shell
-----------------------
The files COMPLETION-BASH, COMPLETION-TCSH and COMPLETION-ZSH in the
docs subdirectory give cookbook examples of how to use the enhanced
features of these shells with nmh. There is also a section in Jerry
Peek's book covering nmh/MH and working with the shell. The section is
available online at <http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/mh/mhanthsh.html>.

For More information
--------------------
There is more information, including a FAQ and a bit of historical
information in the docs subdirectory. There are also links to further
documentation on the nmh website located at <http://nmh.nongnu.org/>.
