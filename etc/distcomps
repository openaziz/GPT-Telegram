%; distcomps - Our components file for "dist"
%;
%; This is modeled after the components file for forw, so check that
%; file for more explanation as to what is going on here.
%;
%; When using "dist" we have to use the special Resent- headers, since
%; we're keeping the original headers of the message intact.
%;
%; All of the header components from the original message are available
%; if you wish to use them.
