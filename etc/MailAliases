; MailAliases -- nmh global aliases file
;
; This file is used to define aliases that are valid for all mh users.
; This file is almost empty as MH now supports personal aliases.
;
; If you need to define system wide aliases such as "everyone", it is
; preferable that this be done as the mail transport level, so that they
; will be valid for users of other mail clients.

; everyone: *

; Blank lines and lines beginning with a ;, :, or # are ignored.
; < file	-> read more aliases from "file"
; foo: fum      -> simple replacement
; foo: fum, fie -> list replacement
; foo: < file   -> list replacement from "file"
; foo: = group  -> list replacement from UNIX group
; foo: + group  -> list replacement by ALL users in /etc/passwd
;		      with gid == group
; foo: *        -> list replacement by ALL users in /etc/passwd
;                     with uid >= 200
; foo*: fum     -> matches foo<string> (including the empty string)
;
; using a ';' instead of a ':' indicates that the alias should be displayed
; along with the addresses used (normally, the addresses replace the alias
; completely)
;
; A backslash at the end of a line escapes the following newline, even
; in comment lines.  Thus, comments endinf with a \ will be continued even
# without a leading ;, :, or # on the followling line.
