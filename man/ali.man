.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ali
searches the named mail alias files for each of the given
.IR aliases .
It creates a list of addresses for those
.IR aliases ,
and writes that list on standard output.  If no arguments are given,
.B ali
outputs all alias entries.
.PP
By default, when an alias expands to multiple addresses, the addresses
are separated by commas and printed on as few lines as possible.  If the
.B \-list
switch is specified, and an address expands to multiple
addresses, each address will appear on a separate line.
.PP
The
.B \-user
switch directs
.B ali
to perform its processing in
an inverted fashion: instead of listing the addresses that each given
alias expands to,
.B ali
will list the aliases that expand to each
given address.
.PP
The files specified by the profile entry
.RI \*(lq Aliasfile \*(rq
and any additional alias files given by the
.B \-alias
.I aliasfile
switch will be read.  Each
.I alias
is processed as described in
.IR mh\-alias (5).
.SH FILES
Alias files are looked up in multiple locations: if the pathname is
absolute or starts with
.RI \*(lq . \*(rq
or
.RI \*(lq .. \*(rq
it is accessed directly; otherwise tilde expansion is done on
usernames, then files are searched for in the user's
.I Mail
directory as specified in their profile.  If not found there, the directory
.RI \*(lq %nmhetcdir% \*(rq
is checked.
