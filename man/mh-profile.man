.SH NAME
mh-profile, mh_profile \- user customization for nmh message handler
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each user of
.B nmh
is expected to have a file named
.I \&.mh\-profile
in their home directory.  This file contains
a set of user parameters used by the
.B nmh
family of programs.  Each entry in the file is of the format
.PP
.RS 5
.IR profile-component ": " value
.RE
.PP
If the text of a profile entry is long, you may extend it across several
real lines by indenting the continuation lines with leading spaces or tabs.
Comments may be introduced by a line starting with `#:':
.PP
.RS 5
.IR # ": "
This is a comment.
.RE
.PP
Blank lines are not permitted in
.IR \&.mh\-profile .
Shell quoting conventions are not available; each token is separated
by whitespace.
.SS "Standard Profile Entries"
The possible profile components are exemplified below.  The only mandatory
entry is `Path:'.  The others are optional; some have default values if
they are not present.  In the notation used below, (profile, default)
indicates whether the information is kept in the user's
.B nmh
profile or
.B nmh
context, and indicates what the default value is.  Note that a profile
component can only appear once.  Multiple appearances will trigger a
warning that all appearances after the first are ignored.
.PP
Some MH programs, including
.BR mhbuild ,
.BR mhshow ,
and
.BR mhstore ,
have specific profile components that are described in their respective
man pages.  Each component name specific to these programs begins with
the name of the program and is followed by a dash.
.PP
.BR Path :
Mail
.RS 5
Locates
.B nmh
transactions in directory \*(lqMail\*(rq.  A relative Path starts from
the user's home directory.  This is the only mandatory profile entry.
(profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR locale :
locale
.RS 5
Set the locale for all
.B nmh
programs except
.BR post ,
.BR install-mh ,

section below for a reference on how the locale is set if this profile
component is not used.
.RE
.PP
.BR context :
context
.RS 5
Declares the location of the
.B nmh
context file.  This can be overridden by the environment variable
MHCONTEXT.
See the
.B HISTORY
section below.
(profile, default: <nmh-dir>/context)
.RE

.RS 5
Defines the name of the default inbox.
(profile, default: inbox)
.RE
.PP
.BR Previous\-Sequence :
.I pseq
.RS 5
Names the sequence or sequences which should be defined as the `msgs' or
`msg' argument given to any
.B nmh
command.  If not present or empty,
no such sequences are defined.  Otherwise, for each name given, the
sequence is first zeroed and then each message is added to the sequence.
Read
.IR mh\-sequence (5)
for the details about this sequence.  (profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR Sequence\-Negation :
not
.RS 5
Defines the string which, when prefixed to a sequence name, negates
that sequence.  Hence, \*(lqnotseen\*(rq means all those messages that
are not a member of the sequence \*(lqseen\*(rq.  Read
.IR mh\-sequence (5)
for the details.  (profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR Unseen\-Sequence :
unseen
.RS 5
Names the sequence or sequences which should be defined as those
messages which are unread.  The commands
.BR inc ,
.BR rcvstore ,
.BR mhshow ,
and
.B show
will add or remove messages from these
sequences when they are incorporated or read.  If not present or
empty, no such sequences are defined.  Otherwise, each message is
added to, or removed from, each sequence name given.  Read
.IR mh\-sequence (5)
for the details about this sequence.
(profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR mh\-sequences :
\&.mh\-sequences

.RE
.PP
.IR program :
.I default switches
.RS 5
Sets default switches to be used whenever the mh program
.I program
is invoked.  For example, one could override the \*(lqEditor:\*(rq profile
component when replying to messages by adding a component such as:
.PP
.RS 5
repl: \-editor /bin/ed

.RE
.PP
.IB lasteditor "-next:"
.I nexteditor
.RS 5
Names \*(lqnexteditor\*(rq to be the default editor after using
\*(lqlasteditor\*(rq.  This takes effect at the \*(lqWhat now?\*(rq prompt
in
.BR comp ,
.BR dist ,
.BR forw ,
and
.BR repl .
After editing the draft with \*(lqlasteditor\*(rq, the default editor is
set to be \*(lqnexteditor\*(rq.  If the user types \*(lqedit\*(rq without
any arguments to \*(lqWhat now?\*(rq, then \*(lqnexteditor\*(rq is used.

.PP
.BR Local\-Mailbox :
Your Username <user@some.host>
.RS 5
Tells the MH programs what your local mailbox is.  If set, it will be used
by the default component files by programs like
.B comp
and
.B repl
to construct your default \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header.  The text used here will
be copied exactly to your \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header, so it should already be RFC
822 compliant.  If this is set, the
.B Signature
profile entry is
.I not
used, so it should include a signature as well.  (profile,
default: userid@local.hostname)
.RE
.PP
.BR Alternate\-Mailboxes :
mh@uci\-750a, bug-mh*
.RS 5
Tells
.B repl
and
.B scan
which additional addresses are yours.  In this way,
.B repl
knows which addresses should be included in the reply, and
.B scan
knows if a message originated from you.  Addresses must be separated by a comma,
and the hostnames listed should be the \*(lqofficial\*(rq hostnames for the
mailboxes you indicate, as local nicknames for hosts are not replaced with
their official site names.  For each address, if a host is not given, then
that address on any host is considered to be you.  In addition, an asterisk
(`*') may appear at either or both ends of the mailbox and host to indicate
wild-card matching.  (profile, default: your user-id)

your mail signature.  (This is not to be confused with a .signature
that might be appended to mails.) This is superseded by the environment
variable SIGNATURE.  If SIGNATURE is not set and this profile entry is
not present, the \*(lqgcos\*(rq field of the \fI/etc/passwd\fP file
will be used.  Your signature will be added to the address

.SS "Profile Lookup"
After consulting .mh_profile, some programs read an optional profile
specified by a program-specific environment variable, and then the
system-wide profile %nmhetcdir%/mhn.defaults.
These programs are
.BR mhbuild ,
.BR mhshow ,
.BR mhstore ,
and
.BR mhn .
.B mhfixmsg
is similar, but has no optional profile.
.PP
The first occurrence of a component is used, e.g.\& .mh_profile's
trumps $MHSHOW's.  A component with no value still stops further
occurrences being used, but is considered absent.
.PP
The
.I \&.mh\-profile
contains only static information, which
.B nmh
programs will
.I not
update.  Changes in context are made to the
.I context
file kept in the users
.B nmh
directory.  This includes, but is not limited to: the
\*(lqCurrent\-Folder\*(rq entry and all private sequence information.
Public sequence information is kept in each folder in the file
determined by the \*(lqmh\-sequences\*(rq profile entry (default is
.IR \&.mh\-sequences ).
.PP
The
.I \&.mh\-profile
may override the path of the
.I context
file, by specifying a \*(lqcontext\*(rq entry (this must be in
lower-case).  If the entry is not absolute (does not start with a
\*(lq/\*(rq), then it is interpreted relative to the user's
.B nmh
directory.  As a result, you can actually have more than one set of
private sequences by using different context files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The operation of
.B nmh
and its commands it also controlled by the
presence of certain environment variables.
.PP
Many of these environment variables are used internally by the
\*(lqWhat now?\*(rq interface.  It's amazing all the information
that has to get passed via environment variables to make the
\*(lqWhat now?\*(rq interface look squeaky clean to the
.B nmh
user, isn't it?  The reason for all this is that the
.B nmh
user can select any program as the
.IR whatnowproc ,
including one of the standard shells.  As a result, it's not possible
to pass information via an argument list.  The convention is that
environment variables whose names are all upper-case are user-settable;
those whose names are lower-case only are used internally by nmh and
should not generally be set by the user.
.TP
HOME
If set and non-null, it is used as the user's home directory.
If not set or null, then getpwuid(3)'s pw_dir is used.
.TP
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG
These variables are used to set the locale, see locale(1).
The \*(lqlocale\*(rq profile entry supersedes these.
.TP
MAILDROP
This variable tells
.B inc
the default mail drop.  This supersedes the \*(lqMailDrop\*(rq
profile entry.
.TP
MAILHOST
This variable tells
.B inc
the POP host to query for mail to incorporate.  See
.IR inc (1)
for more information.
.TP
MH
With this environment variable, you can specify a profile
other than
.I \&.mh\-profile
to be read by the
.B nmh
programs that you invoke.  If the value of MH is not absolute,
(i.e., does not begin with a \*(lq/\*(rq), it will be presumed
to start from the current working directory.  This is one of the
very few exceptions in
.B nmh
where non-absolute pathnames are not considered relative to the user's
.B nmh

.TP
MHBUILD
With this environment variable, you can specify an additional user profile

.BR mhbuild ,
in addition to the mhn.defaults profile.

.SH BUGS
There is some question as to what kind of arguments should be placed
in the profile as options.  In order to provide a clear answer, recall
the command line semantics of all
.B nmh
programs: conflicting switches
(e.g.
.B \-header
and
.BR \-noheader )
may occur more than one time on the command line, with the last switch
taking effect.  Other arguments, such as message sequences, filenames
and folders, are always remembered on the invocation line and are not
superseded by following arguments of the same type.
Hence, it is safe to place only switches (and their arguments) in the profile.
.PP
If one finds that an
.B nmh
program is being invoked again and again with the same arguments, and those
arguments aren't switches, then there are a few possible solutions to this
problem.  The first is to create a (soft) link in your
.I $HOME/bin
directory to the
.B nmh
program of your choice.  By giving this link a different name, you can create
a new entry in your profile and use an alternate set of defaults for
the
.B nmh
command.  Similarly, you could create a small shell script
which called the
.B nmh
program of your choice with an alternate set
of invocation line switches (using links and an alternate profile entry
is preferable to this solution).
.PP
Finally, the
.B csh
user could create an alias for the command of the form:
.PP
.RS 5
alias cmd 'cmd arg1 arg2 ...'
.RE
.PP
In this way, the user can avoid lengthy type-in to the shell, and still
give
.B nmh
commands safely.  (Recall that some
.B nmh
commands
invoke others, and that in all cases, the profile is read, meaning that
aliases are disregarded beyond an initial command invocation)
