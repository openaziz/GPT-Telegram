.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rcvstore
incorporates a message from the standard input into an
.B nmh
folder.  This command is typically used in conjunction with
mail filtering programs such as
.B slocal
and
.BR procmail ,
to filter your mail into different folders.
.PP
You may specify which folder to use with
.IR +folder .
If no folder is specified,
.B rcvstore
will use the folder given by a non-empty \*(lqInbox:\*(rq entry in
the user's profile, else it will use the folder named \*(lqinbox\*(rq.
.PP
If the switch
.B \-create
is given (it is the default) and if the specified
(or default) folder does not exist, then it will be created.  You may
disable this with the
.B \-nocreate
option.  In this case
.B rcvstore
will exit if the specified folder does not exist.
.PP
When the new message is incorporated into the folder, it is assigned
the next highest number for that folder.
.PP
.B rcvstore
will incorporate anything except zero length messages into the user's
.B nmh
folder.  It will not change the message in any way.
.PP
If the user's profile contains a
.RI \*(lq "Msg\-Protect: nnn" \*(rq
entry, it will be used as the mode to use, in octal, on the newly created
message, otherwise the
.B nmh
default mode of 0600, see
.IR chmod (1),
will be used (on filesystems that support it).
For all subsequent operations on this message, this initially assigned
mode will be preserved.
.PP
If the switch
.B \-unseen
is given (it is on by default), and if the profile entry
\*(lqUnseen\-Sequence\*(rq is present and non-empty, then
.B rcvstore
will add the newly incorporated message to each sequence
named by this profile entry.  You may use the switch
.B \-nounseen
to disable this.  These sequences will not be zeroed by
.B rcvstore
prior to adding the new message.
.PP
Furthermore, the incoming messages may be added to additional sequences
as they arrive by the use of the
.B \-sequence
switch.  As with the commands
.B pick
and
.BR mark ,
you may also use the switches
.B \-zero
and
.B \-nozero
to specify whether to zero old sequences or not.
Similarly, use of the
.B \-public
and
.B \-nopublic
switches may be used to force these sequences to be public or
private sequences.
.SS Locking and sequences
If you use the \*(lqUnseen-Sequence\*(rq profile entry, or if you
use the
.B \-sequence
argument, 
.B rcvstore
might try to update its sequence state while another
.B nmh
process is also trying to do so.  This can cause one of those updates
to be lost.  To avoid this (just between asynchronous invocations of
.BR rcvstore ),
always use it with an external locking mechanism.  A
.IR procmailrc (5)
local lockfile would work, or if not using procmail, then consider using
.IR dotlockfile (1)
or
.IR flock (1).
