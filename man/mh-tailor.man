.SH NAME
mh-tailor, mts.conf \- mail transport configuration for nmh message handler
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I %nmhetcdir%/mts.conf
defines run-time options for those
.B nmh
programs which interact (in some form) with the message transport system.
At present, these (user) programs are:
.BR ap ,
.BR inc ,
.BR msgchk ,
.BR post ,
.BR rcvdist ,
and
.BR rcvpack .
.PP
Each option should be given on a single line.  Blank lines and lines
which begin with `#' are ignored.  The options available along with
default values and a description of their meanings are listed below:
.PP
.BR mts :
.RS 5
The mail transport method to use.  The three acceptable options are
.B smtp
(which is the default),
.BR sendmail/smtp ,
and
.BR sendmail/pipe .
.PP
If you use
.BR smtp ,
this will enable a direct SMTP interface in
.BR nmh .
When sending mail, instead of passing the message to the mail
transport agent,
.B post
will open a socket connection to the mail port on the machine
specified in the
.B servers
entry.
.PP
If you use
.BR sendmail/smtp ,
then
.B post
will send messages by forking a local copy of
.BR sendmail .
It will still speak SMTP with this local copy of
.BR sendmail .
For backward compatibility,
.B sendmail/smtp
can be abbreviated to
.BR sendmail .
.PP
The third alternative,
.BR sendmail/pipe ,
also forks a local copy of
.B sendmail
but feeds the message directly to it, using
.B sendmail
.BR \-t .
This replaces the old, undocumented
.B spost
mechanism and retains some of its limitations, such as lack of
support for the \*(lqDcc:\*(rq header field, as described in the
.B send
and
.B post
manual pages.
.RE
.PP
.BR localname :
.RS 5
The hostname
.B nmh
considers local.  It should typically be a fully qualified hostname.
If this is not set, depending on the version of Unix you're running,
.B nmh
will query the system for this value (e.g.\& uname, gethostname, etc.),
and attempt to fully qualify this value.
.PP
If you are using POP to retrieve new messages, you may want to set this
value to the name of the POP server, so that outgoing messages appear to
have originated on the POP server.
.RE
.PP
.BR localdomain :
.RS 5
If this is set, a `.' followed by this string will be appended to your
hostname.
.PP
This should only be needed, if for some reason
.B nmh
is not able to fully qualify the hostname returned by the system
(e.g.\& uname, gethostname, etc.).
.RE
.PP
.BR clientname :
.RS 5
This option specifies the host name that
.B nmh
will give in the SMTP
.B HELO
(and
.BR EHLO )
command, when posting mail.  If not set, the default is to use the
host name that
.B nmh
considers local (see
.B localname
above).  If this option is set, but empty, no
.B HELO
command will be given.
.PP
Although the
.B HELO
command is required by RFC 821, many SMTP servers do not require it.
Early versions of
.I SendMail
will fail if the hostname given in the
.B HELO
command is the local host.  Later versions of
.I SendMail
will complain if you omit the
.B HELO
command.  If you run
.IR SendMail ,
find out what your system expects and set this field if needed.
.RE
.PP
.BR systemname :
.RS 5
This option is only used for UUCP mail.  It specifies the name of the
local host in the UUCP \*(lqdomain\*(rq.  If not set, depending
on the version of Unix you're running,
.B nmh
will query the system
for this value.  This has no equivalent in the
.B nmh
configuration
file.
.RE
.PP
.BR mmdfldir :
%mailspool%
.RS 5
The directory where mail drops are kept.  If this option is set, but empty,
the user's home directory is used.  This overrides the default value
chosen at the time of compilation.
.RE
.PP
.BR mmdflfil :
.RS 5
The name of the mail drop file in the directory where mail drops are kept.
If this is empty, the user's login name is used.  This overrides the default
value (which is empty).
.RE
.PP
.BR spoollocking :
%default_locking%
.RS 5
The locking algorithm to use when opening the mail drop.  Can be any one of
the following:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
%supported_locks%
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
.BR maildelivery :
%nmhlibexecdir%/maildelivery
.RS 5
The name of the system-wide default
.I maildelivery
file.
See
.IR slocal (1)
for the details.
.RE
.SS "SMTP support"
This option is only available if you set
.B mts
to
.BR smtp .
.PP
.BR servers :
localhost
.RS 5
A single hostname to be used when performing mail submission via SMTP.
Previous versions of
.B nmh
supported multiple hostnames for
.BR servers ,
but the current version of
.B nmh
only supports a single entry (the name is kept for backwards compatibility
reasons).  This can be overridden via the
.B \-server
switch to
.IR send (1).
It is not possible to change the mail submission port number in the
.B servers
entry; see the
.B \-port
switch to
.IR send (1)
for this functionality.
.SS "SendMail"
This option is only available if you set
.B mts
to
.B sendmail/smtp
or
.BR sendmail/pipe .
.PP
.BR sendmail :
%sendmailpath%
.RS 5
The pathname to the
.B sendmail
program.
.RE
.SS "Post Office Protocol"
.BR pophost :
.RS 5
The name of the default POP service host.  If this is not set, then
.B nmh
looks in the standard mail drop areas for waiting mail, otherwise
the named POP service host is consulted.
.RE
.\"  .SS "BBoards Delivery"
.\"  This option is only available if you compiled \fInmh\fP with
.\"  \*(lqbbdelivery:\ on\*(rq.
.\"  .PP
.\"  .BR bbdomain :
.\"  .RS 5
.\"  The local BBoards domain (a UCI hack).
.\"  .RE
.\"  .SS "BBoards & The POP"
.\"  These options are only available if you compiled \fInmh\fP with
.\"  \*(lqbboards:\ pop\*(rq and \*(lqpop:\ on\*(rq.
.\"  .PP
.\"  .BR popbbhost :
.\"  .RS 5
.\"  The POP service host which also acts as a BBoard server.  This variable
.\"  should be set on the POP BBoards client host.
.\"  .RE
.\"  .PP
.\"  .BR popbbuser :
.\"  .RS 5
.\"  The guest account on the POP/BB service host.  This should be a different
.\"  login ID than either the POP user or the BBoards user.  (The user-id
.\"  \*(lqftp\*(rq is highly recommended.)  This variable should be set on
.\"  both the POP BBoards client and service hosts.
.\"  .RE
.\"  .PP
.\"  .BR popbblist :
.\"  %nmhetcdir%/hosts.popbb
.\"  .RS 5
.\"  A file containing of lists of hosts that are allowed to use the POP
.\"  facility to access BBoards using the guest account.  If this file is not
.\"  present, then no check is made.  This variable should be set on the POP
.\"  BBoards service host.
.\"  .RE
.SS "File Locking"
A few words on locking:
.B nmh
has two main uses for locking: locking the mail spool during mail
incorporation, and locking metadata files (sequence files, the context)
during updates.  These locking methods can be configured separately
from each other.
.PP
For locking the mail spool, the
.B spoollocking
entry in
.IR mh\-tailor (5)
will control the locking algorithm to use when
.B inc
incorporates mail from the spool file.  If no entry is given, a default
based on the operating system type will be chosen.
.PP
For locking all other files, the
.B datalocking
entry in
.IR mh-profile (5)
controls the locking algorithm used for all other file access.
If no entry is given, the
.B fcntl
lock method will be chosen.
.PP
If you do not wish to use kernel-based locking,
.I dot
locking is an option available.  If \*(lq--enable-lockdir=directory\*(rq
is not specified at build time, lock files will be created in the
directory where the file being locked resides.  Otherwise, lock
files will be created in the directory specified by
\*(lq--enable-lockdir\*(rq.
.PP
Prior to installing
.BR nmh ,
you should see how locking is done at your site, and set the appropriate values.

.SH DEFAULTS
As listed above.  The path of the mail transport configuration file can
be changed with the MHMTSCONF environment variable and augmented with the
MHMTSUSERCONF environment variable, see
.IR mh\-profile (5).
.SH BUGS
Failure to open any mail transport configuration file is silently
ignored.  Therefore, it's best to avoid dynamic creation of such
a file with the intent of use via the MHMTSCONF or MHMTSUSERCONF
environment variables.  If such use is necessary, the ability
to successfully open the file should first be verified.
