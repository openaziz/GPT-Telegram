.SH DESCRIPTION
.B forw
constructs a new message from a forms (components) file, with a body
composed of the message(s) to be forwarded.  An editor is invoked
and, after editing is complete, the user is prompted before the
message is sent.
.PP
The default message template will direct
.B forw
to construct the draft as follows:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
From: {from switch} or <Local-Mailbox> or <username@hostname>
To: {to switch} or blank
Fcc: {fcc switch} or +outbox
Subject: {subject switch} or "{original subject} (fwd)"
--------
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a file named
.RI \*(lq forwcomps \*(rq
exists in the user's nmh directory,
it will be used instead of this default form.  You may also specify an
alternate forms file with the switch
.B \-form
.IR formfile .
Forms are processed via the
.B nmh
template system; see
.IR mh\-format (5)
for details.  Components from the first forwarded message are available
as standard component escapes in the forms file.
.PP
In addition to the standard
.I mh\-format
escapes, the following
.I component
escapes are also supported:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
.ta \w'nmh\-subject	'u +\w'Returns	'u
.I "Escape	Returns	Description"
fcc	string	Any folders specified with `\-fcc\ folder'
nmh\-from	string	Addresses specified with `\-from\ address'
nmh\-to	string	Addresses specified with `\-to\ address'
nmh\-cc	string	Addresses specified with `\-cc\ address'
nmh\-subject	string	Any text specified with `\-subject\ text'
.fi
.RE
.PP
By default, the \*(lqTo:\*(rq and \*(lqcc:\*(rq fields are empty.  You may
add addresses to these fields with the
.B \-to
.I address
and
.B \-cc
.I address
switches.  You may give these switches multiple times to add multiple
addresses.
.PP
By default, the \*(lqFrom:\*(rq field contains either the value of the
.B Local\-Mailbox
profile entry, or a system default email address.
This default can be overridden by using the
.B \-from
.I address
switch.  The default mailbox in the \*(lqFcc:\*(rq field is
.IR +outbox .
This can be overridden by the
.B \-fcc
switch.
.PP
Any text given to the
.B \-subject
switch will be placed in the \*(lqSubject:\*(rq field in the draft.
.PP
If the draft already exists,
.B forw
will ask you as to the disposition of the draft.  A reply of
.B quit
will abort
.BR forw ,
leaving the draft intact;
.B replace
will replace the existing draft with a blank skeleton; and
.B list
will display the draft.
.PP
If the
.B \-annotate
switch is given, each message being forwarded will be annotated
with the lines:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
Forwarded:\ date
Forwarded:\ addrs
.fi
.RE
.PP
where each address list contains as many lines as required.
This annotation will be done only if the message is sent directly from
.BR forw .
If the message is not sent immediately from
.BR forw ,
.RB \*(lq comp
.BR \-use \*(rq
may be used to re-edit and send the constructed message, but the
annotations won't take place.  Normally, annotations are done in place
in order to preserve any links to the message.
You may change this by using the
.B \-noinplace
switch.
.PP
See
.IR comp (1)
for a description of the
.B \-editor
and
.B \-noedit
switches.
.PP
Although
.B forw
uses a forms (components) file to construct the initial draft,
a message filter file is used to format each forwarded message in the
body of the draft.
The filter file for \fIforw\fR should be a standard form file for
.IR mhl (1),
as
.B forw
will invoke
.B mhl
to filter (re-format) the forwarded messages prior to being output to
the body of the draft.
.PP
The switches
.BR \-noformat ,
.BR \-format ,
and
.B \-filter
.I filterfile
specify which message filter file to use.  If
.B \-noformat
is specified (this is the default), then each forwarded
message is output into the draft exactly as it appears, with no
.B mhl
filtering.  If
.B \-format
is specified, then the following default message filter file,
.RI \*(lq mhl.forward \*(rq ,
which should be adequate for most users, is used:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
%mhl_forward%
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a file named
.RI \*(lq mhl.forward \*(rq
exists in the user's nmh
directory, it will be used instead.  You may specify an
alternate message filter file with the switch
.B \-filter
.IR filterfile .
.PP
Each forwarded message is separated with an encapsulation delimiter.
By default, any dashes in the first column of the forwarded messages
will be prepended with `\-\ ' so that when received, the message is
suitable for bursting by
.IR burst (1).
This follows the guidelines in RFC 934.  You may use the
.B \-nodashstuffing
switch to suppress this form of quoting.
.PP
Users of
.IR prompter (1)
can, by specifying
.BR prompter 's
.B \-prepend
switch in the
.I \&.mh_profile
file, prepend any commentary text before the forwarded messages.
.PP
To use the MIME rules for encapsulation, specify the
.B \-mime
switch.  This directs
.B forw
to generate an
.B mhbuild
composition file.  Note that
.B nmh
will not invoke
.B mhbuild
automatically; you must specifically give the command
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
What now? mime
.fi
.RE
.PP
prior to sending the draft.
.PP
The
.B \-draftfolder
.I +folder
and
.B \-draftmessage
.I msg
switches invoke the
.B nmh
draft folder facility.  This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult
.IR mh-draft (5)
for more information.
.PP
The
.B \-editor
.I editor
switch indicates the editor to use for the initial edit.
Upon exiting from the editor,
.B comp
will invoke the
.B whatnow
program.  See
.IR whatnow (1)
for a discussion of
available options.
The invocation of this program can be inhibited by using the
.B \-nowhatnowproc
switch.  (In fact, it is the
.I whatnow
program which starts the initial edit.  Hence,
.B \-nowhatnowproc
will prevent any edit from occurring.)
.PP
The
.B \-build
switch is intended to be used by the Emacs mh-e interface to
.BR nmh .
It implies
.BR \-nowhatnowproc .
It causes a file <mh-dir>/draft
to be created, containing the draft message that would normally be
presented to the user for editing.  No mail is actually sent.
.PP
The
.B \-file
.I msgfile
switch specifies the message to be forwarded as an exact filename
rather than as an
.B nmh
folder and message number.  This switch implies
.BR \-noannotate .
The forwarded message is simply copied verbatim into the draft;
the processing implied by the
.BR \-filter ,
.BR \-mime ,
and
.B \-digest
switches is bypassed, and the usual leading and
trailing 'Forwarded Message' delimiters are not added.
The same caveats apply to this option as to the
.B \-build
switch.
.PP
The
.B \-digest
.IR list ,
.B \-issue
.IR number ,
and
.B \-volume
.I number
switches implement a digest facility for
.BR nmh .
Specifying these switches enables and/or overloads the following escapes:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
.ta \w'Component  'u +\w'Escape  'u +\w'Returns  'u
.I "Type	Escape	Returns	Description"
component	digest	string	Argument to `\-digest'
function	cur	integer	Argument to `\-volume'
function	msg	integer	Argument to `\-issue'
.fi

.RI \*(lq %nmhetcdir% \*(rq
is checked.

.SH CONTEXT
If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.
The first message forwarded will become the current message.
.SH BUGS
If
.I whatnowproc
is
.BR whatnow ,
then
.B forw
uses a built-in
.BR whatnow ,
it does not actually run the
.B whatnow
program.
Hence, if you define your own
.IR whatnowproc ,
don't call it
.B whatnow
since
.B forw
won't run it.
.PP
When
.B forw
is told to annotate the messages it forwards, it doesn't actually
annotate them until the draft is successfully sent.
If, from the
.IR whatnowproc ,
you
.B push
instead of
.BR send ,
it is possible to confuse
.B forw
by re-ordering the file (e.g.\& by using
.RB \*(lq folder
.BR \-pack \*(rq)
before the message is successfully sent.
.B dist
and
.B repl
don't have this problem.
