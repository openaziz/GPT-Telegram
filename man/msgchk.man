.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B msgchk
program checks all known mail drops for mail waiting
for you.  For those drops which have mail for you,
.B msgchk
will
indicate if it believes that you have seen the mail in question before.
.PP
The
.B \-notify
.I type
switch indicates under what circumstances
.B msgchk
should produce a message.  The default is
.B \-notify
.I all
which says that
.B msgchk
should always report the status of the
users mail drop.  Other values for `type' include `mail' which says that
.B msgchk
should report the status of waiting mail; and, `nomail'
which says that
.B msgchk
should report the status of empty mail drops.
The
.B \-nonotify
.I type
switch has the inverted sense, so
.B \-nonotify
.I all
directs
.B msgchk
to never report the status of
mail drops.  This is useful if the user wishes to check
.BR msgchk 's
exit status.  A non-zero exit status indicates that mail was
.I not
waiting for at least one of the indicated users.
.PP
If
.B msgchk
produces output, then the
.B \-date
switch directs
.B msgchk
to print out the last date mail was read, if this can
be determined.
.SS "Using POP"
.B msgchk
will normally check all the local mail drops, but if
the option \*(lqpophost:\*(rq is set in the mts configuration file
\*(lqmts.conf\*(rq, or if the
.B \-host
.I hostname
switch is given,
.B msgchk
will query this POP service host as to the status of
mail waiting.  The
.B \-port
switch specifies the port name or number used to connect to the POP
server.  If unspecified, the default is \*(lqpop3\*(rq.
.PP
To specify a username for authentication with the POP server, use the
.B \-user
.I username
switch.  The credentials profile entry in
.IR mh\-profile (5)
describes the ways to supply a username and password.
.PP
For debugging purposes, there is also a switch
.BR \-snoop ,
which will
allow you to watch the POP transaction take place between you and the
POP server.  If
.B \-sasl \-saslmech xoauth2
is used, the HTTP transaction is also shown.
.PP
If
.B nmh
has been compiled with SASL support, the
.B \-sasl
switch will enable
the use of SASL authentication.  Depending on the SASL mechanism used, this
may require an additional password prompt from the user (but the
.I netrc
file can be used to store this password, as described in
.IR mh-profile (5).
The
.B \-saslmech
switch can be used to select a particular SASL mechanism.
.PP
If SASL authentication is successful,
.B msgchk
will attempt to negotiate
a security layer for session encryption.  Encrypted traffic is labelled
with `(encrypted)' and `(decrypted)' when viewing the POP transaction
with the
.B \-snoop
switch; see
.IR post (8)'s
description of
.B \-snoop
for its other features.
.PP
If
.B nmh
has been compiled with OAuth support, the
.B \-sasl \-saslmech xoauth2
switch will enable OAuth authentication.  The
.B \-user
switch must be used, and the
.I user-name
must be an email address the user has for the service, which must
be specified with the
.B \-authservice
.I service
switch.  Before using this, the user must authorize nmh by running
.B mhlogin
and grant authorization to that account.  See
.IR mhlogin (1)
for more details.
.PP
If
.B nmh
has been compiled with TLS support, the
.B \-tls
and
.B \-initialtls
switches will require the negotiation of TLS when connecting
to the remote POP server.  The
.B \-tls
switch will negotiate TLS as part of the normal POP protocol using
the STLS command.  The
.B \-initialtls
switch will negotiate TLS immediately after the connection has taken place,
before any POP commands are sent or received.  Data encrypted by TLS is
labeled `(tls-encrypted)' and `(tls-decrypted)' with viewing the POP
transaction with the
.B \-snoop
switch.  The
.B \-notls
switch will disable all attempts to negotiate TLS.
.PP
When using TLS the default is to verify the remote certificate and SubjectName
against the local trusted certificate store.  This can be controlled by
the
.B \-certverify
and
.B \-nocertverify
switches.  See your OpenSSL documentation for more information on certificate
verification.
