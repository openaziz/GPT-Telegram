.SH DESCRIPTION
.B install\-mh
creates the initial setup for a first-time
.B nmh
user.
.B install\-mh
is installed in two locations for historical reasons.
.PP
The \fB\-auto\fP switch does things as automatically as possible and
makes \fBinstall\-mh\fP less chatty.
.PP
The user is prompted for the name of the directory to be
designated as the user's
.B nmh
directory.  If this directory does not exist, the user is asked if
it should be created.  Normally, this directory should be under
the user's home directory, and has the default name of
\fI`Mail'\fP.
.B install\-mh
writes an initial
.I \&.mh_profile
for the user.
.PP
As with all
.B nmh
commands,
.B install\-mh
first checks for the existence of the \fB$MH\fP environment variable,
since that, if set, gives the profile path.
If it isn't set, the
.B $HOME
environment variable is consulted to determine the user's home directory.
If
.B $HOME
is not set, then the
.I /etc/passwd
file is consulted.
.PP
When creating the user's
.IR \&.mh_profile ,
.B install\-mh
will check for the existence of a global profile at
.IR %nmhetcdir%/mh.profile .
If found, this will be used to initialize the new
.IR \&.mh_profile .
.PP
The \fB\-check\fP switch checks if
.B nmh
is installed.
(This can be used by other programs to determine if
.B nmh
has been installed.)
.PP
.B install\-mh
sets up the user's profile to support the
.IR mh\-draft (5)
draft folder facility.
