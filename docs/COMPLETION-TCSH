# This file, to be sourced by tcsh, contains useful command completions for nmh.

# [There's lots more that can be done -- folder name completion is just the most
#  useful ...]

# Note that if you use nested folders, the below completions will not find
# them.  If you are in this boat, you might want to use something like:
#
#     set nmh_mail_dirs = `folder -all -fast -recurse`
#
#     complete anno		c%+%"($nmh_mail_dirs)"%
#     [...]
#
# The problem with that is that new folders you create won't be available for
# completion until you re-source this file.
#
# Note also that if you use '%'s in your folder names, you'll need to use a
# different separator character below.

set nmh_mail_dir = $HOME/`mhparam Path`
