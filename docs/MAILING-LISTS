nmh-workers@nongnu.org
----------------------
This is the main list for discussing work on nmh.  There is currently
no nmh-users mailing list, so user questions are acceptable here (the
comp.mail.mh newsgroup is another good option).  Bug reports and
feedback should be submitted here.

  https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nmh-workers


nmh-commits@nongnu.org
----------------------
All commits to the nmh source code repository are copied to this list.
Therefore, it is probably only of interest to nmh developers.
